description: |-
  The Pilgrim is a well-kept two-mast Galleon, wood with metal finishes.

  Above deck, the wooden structure has a healthy oiled appearance. Rope riggings are cleanly-stored and the sails are immaculate.

  Below deck, there are two rows of portholes and four hatches for cannons.

  The only aspect of the ship that looks out of place is the figurehead, it's a  caterpillar!
