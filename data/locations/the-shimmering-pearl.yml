type: Island
parent: the-sea-of-shards
description: |-
  The island is shaped like a crescent, with two larger spires of rock on either side.

  While the island does sport some vegetation, it's mostly beach sand for the crescent, and thick jungle masses in the folds of the rocky spires.

  The sea in the middle of the crescent seems to be bowl-shaped and deepest in the center.

  As you get closer to the beach, you notice that the tops of the vegetation have been chopped off.

  =================================

  This is no longer just an island.

  The bowl of water has been replaced with what looks like a giant pearl, twice as large as The Pilgrim, with a swirling, gas-like exterior.

  The chopped off vegetation makes sense now, as the space above is now occupied by the pearl.
