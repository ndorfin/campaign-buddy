title: Regis the weasel
species: Weasel
size_class: small
description: The cook's pet is a fierce but inquisitive weasel called 'Regis'.
appearance: The weasel is just smaller than your typical house cat, but has a presence of a feral coon, and moves with the speed and grace of a hyperactive snake. It has an Orangey-brown shiny coat on top. The Underparts look dirty, a muddied or creamy white colour. The animal's legs are typical for any weasel, long, with expressive- and almost primate-like arms, adorned with sharp claws. Its teeth are clean and proportionally larger than any weasel you've seen before. It looks at you with hazel eyes in an inquisitive manner, but you can't tell if its gaze is one of curiousity or of measuring. For something so small, it sure does look threatening.
