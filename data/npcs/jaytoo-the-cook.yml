slug: jaytoo-the-cook
name: Jaytoo
title: Jaytoo the cook
species: Human
size_class: medium
description: Jaytoo keeps the crew fed and in good spirits.
appearance: Our cook is a burly, hairy, and sweaty man. He is one of the older members of the crew, but his hair is still thick and black, no sign of going grey just yet. His smile reflects his personality, a warm, jovial, and kind fellow. You'll always see him with his dirty apron on, and a cigar hanging from the side of his mouth, you casually wonder if he even sleeps as such. While he doesn't look after himself too well, he does seem to care for his crew, his pet weasel, and the fine art of cooking.
back_story: Jaytoo hails from the sunny isles where his family have traditionally traded as all manner of food preparers; cooks, bakers, chocolateurs, and even run a mess hall. While he typically dodges any probing questions to his past, he does recount anecdotes from his past in everyday conversations.
