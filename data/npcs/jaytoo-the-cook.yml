species: Human
size_class: medium
description: Jaytoo keeps the crew fed and in good spirits.
appearance: |-
  Our cook is a burly, hairy man. He is one of the older members of the crew, but his hair is still thick and black, no sign of going grey just yet. You'll always see him with his dirty apron on, and a cigar hanging from the side of his mouth, you casually wonder if he even sleeps as such.

  His hands are dextrous and move fast for an overweight man.
back_story: |-
  Jaytoo hails from the sunny isles where his family have traditionally traded as all manner of food preparers; cooks, bakers, and chocolateurs. While he typically dodges any probing questions to his past, he does sometimes drop anecdotes from his past into his everyday conversations.
