description: The Pilgrim's first mate and right-hand-man to the Captain.
appearance: |-
  Criek is the epitome of a crusty sea dog.

  A shawl for a shirt, with a leather belt somehow keeping it all together. A crude scabbard is attached to the belt containing a cutlass of sorts, a sword that could really do with some sharpening.

  Rolled up leggings and leather shoes complete his clothing.

  His skin is wrinkly and brown from the sun, his hair almost completely white from sea bleaching and old-age.

  He smiles at you with yellow teeth.
back_story: |-
  Criek started working for the Captain about 9 years ago after a recruitment drive that started in Dinnesmore's port-side pissing saloon, The Limp Fish. He used to be a regular there.

  Before that he worked as a deck-hand (and eventually first mate) on a spice runner for one of the larger shipping companies.
