name: Silas
title: Silas the hold boy
species: Human
size_class: medium
description: Young, nimble, and tough as nails
appearance: |-
  Silas is young, and dressed about as well as a barefoot beggar.

  His nails have been bitten down to length, and his hair is a rats nest, pulled together at the back with a thin strand of leather.

  At first glance he seems scrawny, but he has a wildness to him that yields strength and dexterity.
