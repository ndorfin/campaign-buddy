species: Human
size_class: medium
description: The Pilgrim's Captain is a no-nonsense type on a mission
appearance: |-
  The first thing you notice about the captain is a scimitar attached to her right hip, her hand always resting above the hilt on her hip.
  On the opposite hip is an ornate leather carry case attached to the belt.

  The captain is physically fit, with an average height. Her skin is bronzed from countless hours spent on the deck of the ship.

  Her clothing style is functional but still stylish, especially when compared to the rest of the crew.

  Her face is obscured by her dark hair and a wide-brimmed hat.
back_story: |-
  Not much is known about the Captain. Any questions into her past will be met with scorn and worse, punishment.
